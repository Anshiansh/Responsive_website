estates and plantations from around the world. Our team visits these plantations to assess 
and determine the quality of coffee before it makes it to our shortlist. Which is why we have 
a really short list, because to us, only the best matter. We also ensure the farms we work 
with are free from slave labour and  malpractice and are  
and follow ethical practices"

                <p>This popular estate was the subject of intrigue after a number of UFO videos emerged <br>from 
                    the region in 2008. We’re sure the UFOs were there for the amazing Arabica <br>that they 
                    cultivate over there. And we agree. Attaca produces some of the finest coffee <br>and we’ve got 
                    them all to prove our point.  </p>

            <p>Our coffee hunt in South India sprung up a surprise in 2019 when we came across <br>Mr. 
                Rajamani Vardha who’s great grandfather established Vardha Plantations in Karnataka, <br>India 
                in the late 1800s on orders of a British general who wanted great coffee. Vardha Plantations still produce their uniquely amazing blend that has come 
                to be a crowd favourite with us.</p>
